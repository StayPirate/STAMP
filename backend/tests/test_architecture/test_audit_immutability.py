"""Structural test enforcing audit event table immutability.

See `docs/features/platform/audit-trail-infrastructure.md`
(Immutability): "No application-level UPDATE or DELETE operations are
permitted on [audit event] tables." This module provides a mechanical
check so the rule does not rely solely on reviewer attention (see
`docs/features/platform/testing-strategy.md`, Structural Tests —
Audit Immutability Testing).

Scope: this test detects the two idiomatic SQLAlchemy 2.0 Core
bulk-mutation forms used throughout this codebase — `update(Model)...`
and `delete(Model)...` — where `Model` is referenced directly by name
as the statement's target. It does not attempt to trace instance-level
`session.delete(instance)` calls back to a specific model class, since
that would require full type inference and would risk false positives
against legitimate deletions of unrelated, non-audit records (see
`AGENTS.md`, Guardrail 26 — Reviewer Proportionality). A direct bulk
`update()`/`delete()` statement is the pattern a retention/cleanup
implementation would realistically use, which is what this test
guards against.

Audit event models are discovered dynamically via
`AuditEventMixin.__subclasses__()`, so this test starts protecting each
new audit trail (ticket, identity, setting, fetcher) automatically as
soon as its model is defined — no update to this test file is needed.
