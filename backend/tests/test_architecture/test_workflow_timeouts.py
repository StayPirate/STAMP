"""Structural test verifying every GitHub Actions job declares a timeout.

GitHub's default job timeout is 360 minutes. Without an explicit
job-level `timeout-minutes`, a hung step (e.g. a stuck `docker build` or
a `compose up --wait` that never becomes healthy) can occupy a runner —
and its `concurrency` group — for up to six hours before GitHub kills
it. See issue #69.

This test parses workflow YAML with a minimal indentation-based scanner
rather than a full YAML parser, to avoid depending on PyYAML, which is
only a transitive dependency of `uvicorn[standard]` and is not declared
directly in `pyproject.toml`.
