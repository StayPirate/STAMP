"""Test-only no-op `BaseFetcher` subclass for the local process system suite.

See `docs/features/platform/testing-strategy.md` (Local Process System
Testing) for the full behavioral contract this class satisfies. This
module MUST NOT be imported by any production entrypoint
(`app/services/fetcher_discovery.py`, the API server, the worker, or
Beat outside a test-owned launcher) — see
`docs/features/platform/fetcher-infrastructure.md` (Registry
Maintenance, Test-only system-fetcher exception).

Importing this module registers `EvaluateTestPipeline` into the
process-local `FETCHER_REGISTRY` as a side effect of
`BaseFetcher.__init_subclass__`. Callers control exactly when that
happens (see `system_fetcher_app.py` for the process-launcher use, and
`backend/tests/system/conftest.py` for the pytest-host registration
fixture) — this module performs no registration on its own beyond the
ordinary Python import mechanism.
