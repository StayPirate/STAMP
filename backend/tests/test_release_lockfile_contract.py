"""Contract tests for Sentinel's release-please policy.

`release-please-config.json` configures a `GenericToml` `extra-files`
updater that patches the `sentinel` package version entry inside
`backend/uv.lock` in the same commit as `backend/pyproject.toml`. This
avoids the race condition where a release PR bumps `pyproject.toml`
without `uv.lock`, causing `uv sync --locked` to fail in CI on the
first push (see PR #46, issue #81).

The updater relies on an undocumented detail of release-please's
internal TOML parser: JSONPath filters must address `@.name.value`
(not the more natural `@.name`) because release-please tags every
parsed TOML scalar as `{start, end, value}` to allow formatting-
preserving edits (see googleapis/release-please#2455). If a future
release-please version changes this internal representation, the
configured jsonpath would silently stop matching, `uv.lock` would no
longer be updated by the release PR, and `uv sync --locked` would fail
in CI on the next release — but only *after* a release PR is opened,
not at commit time on `master`.

This test catches that regression earlier and independently of
release-please's own behavior, by asserting the two invariants the
`extra-files` config depends on:

1. The config still points at `uv.lock` with the exact jsonpath
   selector currently known to work.
2. The `sentinel` package version recorded in `uv.lock` is not
   currently drifted from `pyproject.toml` — i.e., the workaround (or
   a manual `uv lock`) has been kept effective.

This does not simulate release-please's parser; it only guards the
static configuration and the current on-disk consistency. Actual
atomicity is verified manually on the next real release PR (see issue
#81, Verification).
