    Q3: behavior for every case:

    1. If `authorization` is present and its scheme is `Bearer`
       (case-insensitive): if the extracted token value is non-empty
       after stripping whitespace, return it — this is the final

       validation.
    2. Otherwise (no `Authorization` header, an empty/whitespace-only
       Bearer value, or a non-Bearer/unparseable scheme): fall back to
       `cookie`. Return it if present.
    3. If neither yields a credential, return `None`.

    Q6: infallible — never raises.
