"""Password hashing, verification, and validation utilities.

See `docs/features/identity/local-authentication.md` (Password
Management, Hashing configuration) for the authoritative contract this
module implements. Pure Core-layer module: no database or Redis
access, no application imports. All functions are synchronous and
CPU-bound (bcrypt) — callers on the async request path MUST offload
them via `asyncio.to_thread()` rather than awaiting them inline, so a
~cost-12 bcrypt operation never blocks the event loop.

Module-level defaults (`docs/conventions.md`, Function Specification
Completeness): every function in this module is a Category B (pure)
function except `validate_password()`, which raises
`PasswordValidationError` and no other exception. None of these
functions perform I/O, create audit events, or require idempotency
documentation.
