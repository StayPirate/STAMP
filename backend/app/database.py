# a `yield`-based dependency; without an explicit `scope`, FastAPI
# defaults a `yield` dependency to `scope="request"`, whose post-yield
# code (commit/rollback/post-commit callbacks above) runs *after* the
# HTTP response has already been transmitted to the client — breaking
# the "commits before the caller can observe success" guarantee in
# `docs/conventions.md` (Caller-Owned Service Transactions). Declaring
# `scope="function"` here runs that same post-yield code before the
# response is sent, so a commit failure surfaces as a real error
# response instead of an already-decided success one.
#
# Every route (and every dependency nested under a route, e.g.
# authentication) that needs the caller-owned transaction session MUST
# use this alias instead of declaring `Depends(get_db)` inline — see
# `backend/tests/test_api_conventions.py`
# (`TestTransactionDependencyScope`) for the structural test that
# enforces this.
