# Review: networking

**Spec**: `docs/features/platform/networking.md`
**Last reviewed**: 2026-06-25
**Reviewers**: Gap Analysis, Documentation

> Post-split review (fetcher-infrastructure split, Phase 4m). The document
> was created by extracting the shared HTTP client + TLS trust store
> content from the former monolithic `fetcher-infrastructure.md`. The split
> was content-preserving; the gap findings below are pre-existing
> ambiguities, not regressions introduced by the split, and are recorded
> here for future hardening rather than fixed as part of the split exercise.
> Coherence, Design, Security and API Conventions reviewers were not run in
> this round.

## Gap Analysis

### NET-GAP-01 — Transport retry on non-idempotent requests may duplicate writes (High)

**Status**: RESOLVED — Method safety sub-section added to Transport-Level Retry; retry restricted to idempotent methods by default with opt-in for non-idempotent; httpx built-in retry explicitly excluded; IBSClient retry safety documented in ibs-integration.md (2026-06-26)

### NET-GAP-02 — Timing of the missing-CA-file warning is ambiguous (Medium)

**Status**: RESOLVED — SSL context lifecycle clarified: built fresh per create_http_client() invocation, not at startup; warning frequency documented per component type (2026-06-26)

### NET-GAP-03 — Corrupt-CA handling for non-HTTP protocols unspecified (Medium)

**Status**: RESOLVED — Introduced shared `build_tls_context()` function with uniform contract (missing→warning, corrupt→TLSConfigurationError); documented component-specific error handling in ibs-rabbitmq-integration.md (terminate process) and ad-integration.md (fail without retry) (2026-06-26)

### NET-GAP-04 — Connection pool size limits unspecified (Medium)

**Status**: RESOLVED — Explicit pool limits (100 max connections, 20 max keepalive) added to Default Configuration table with override mechanism; note clarifying sequential usage pattern added; pool override example added to fetcher-infrastructure.md Override Mechanism section (2026-06-26)

### NET-GAP-05 — TLS verification override safety not enforced (Medium)

**Status**: RESOLVED — TLS verify documented as overridable with WARNING log; UA remains template-protected (2026-06-26)

### NET-GAP-06 — SSL context caching / certificate rotation behavior unspecified (Medium)

**Status**: RESOLVED — Explicitly specified that SSL context is rebuilt per create_http_client() invocation (no module-level caching); fetchers pick up rotated CA on next run without restart (2026-06-26)

### NET-GAP-07 — Retry-After HTTP-date in the past / clock skew not addressed (Low)

**Status**: RESOLVED — HTTP-date ≤ now() treated as absent; clock skew addressed (2026-06-27)

### NET-GAP-08 — `name` parameter handling for non-fetcher callers unspecified (Low)

**Status**: RESOLVED — Factory signature changed to require name as formal parameter (2026-06-27)

### NET-GAP-09 — Valid-but-wrong CA file (silent failure) not covered (Low)

**Status**: RESOLVED — Auto-resolved: runtime TLS handshake errors provide sufficient diagnostic; no startup validation needed (2026-06-27)

### NET-GAP-10 — Which error propagates on retry exhaustion is unspecified (Low)

**Status**: RESOLVED — Auto-resolved: behavior is implicit (last-error-wins); no consumer relies on this distinction (2026-06-27)

## Documentation

### NET-DOC-01 — Dangling reference to the moved "Shared HTTP Client" section (Medium)

**Status**: RESOLVED — `fetcher-infrastructure.md` (BaseFetcher Base Class,
item 5) pointed to a "Shared HTTP Client" section that no longer exists in
that document after the split. Updated to reference the local "BaseFetcher
HTTP Client Integration" section and `networking.md` ("Shared HTTP
Client") for the full factory spec (2026-06-25)

### NET-DOC-02 — Factory signature omits the required `name` parameter (Low)

**Status**: RESOLVED — Factory signature now declares name: str as required parameter (2026-06-27)
